    <h1>Who am I?</h1> 
    <p>I am a 16 year old high school senior who is passionate about coding and tech development. I'm ambitious, dedicated, and self-motivated. I plan on becoming a big firm lawyer, however, I've always been drawn to coding and artistic expression. Coding has been a life-long hobby of mine since I was first introduced to coding in the form of scratch and lightbot when I was in elementary school.<p>
