    <h1>Who are we?</h1> 
    <p>We're three high schoolers from ESUMS who are passionate about technology and game design. We're seeking to make a measurable social impact through our game. We're ambitious, driven, and dedicated to having our game reach and impact those who find themselves caught in the mind-dulling and biased loop of social media and large media corporations.<p>
