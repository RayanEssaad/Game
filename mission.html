    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>With our game, we seek to change the minds of those who blindly follow narratives and biases pushed by large-scale media corporations and the general public. We seek to inspire people to come to their own conclusion using their own unique perspectives. We hope you enjoy our passion project made with Unreal Engine 5. The puzzle-platformer is the first in our many works that we hope to release in the near future.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Perspective is everything when you are experiencing the challenges of life. - Joni Eareckson Tada</p>
