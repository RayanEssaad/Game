    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>With our game, we seek to change the minds of those who blindly follow narratives and biases pushed by large-scale media corporations and the general public. We seek to inspire people to come to their own conclusion using their own unique perspectives. We hope you enjoy our passion project made with Unreal Engine 5. Our game is still in production, we plan for a much more complete product very soon in the coming months. This is a passion project for the three of us and we have big plans for how our game will progress. The process has been as tedious as it has been joyous. The puzzle-platformer is the first in our many works that we hope to release in the near future.</p>
